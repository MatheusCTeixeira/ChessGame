# ♕ Chess ♛

    A simple implementation of a chess game.
<br />
<br />
My goal in this project is to apply what I learned/studied about OOP, SFML, MVC and improve my knowledge of C ++ 2a (C ++ 20).
<br />
<br />

#### At the end of this project, I will have:
- A chess interface.
- A checker for chess moves.

#### Future Steps:
- I can create chess bots.
- I can add AI to the project, ie use AI to play chess.
